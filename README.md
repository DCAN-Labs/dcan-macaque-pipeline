HCP\_NHP\_generic pipeline

Does not include critical templates used in the macaque pipeline.

It is recommended to use hcponeclick to run the pipeline, as there are many independent pieces which must be stitched together.

The Examples/Scripts directory contains the basic individual building blocks of the pipeline (and some extra).  Running HCPPrep, PreFreeSurfer, FreeGrey, PostFreeSurfer, GenericfMRIVolume, GenericfMRISurface will complete the pipeline, but knowing the inputs to each script can be difficult to keep track of and will not be documented here for some time.
